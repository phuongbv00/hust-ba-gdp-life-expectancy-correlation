Life expectancy is a critical indicator of health in a certain country (or region). This metric depends not only on the
level of medicine in that country but also on its environmental conditions, economic and political context, and social
tendencies.Analyzing the correlation between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and life expectancy is a good idea
for your next business analyst project.

Find a suitable dataset (e.g., [Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)
that provides information on both life expectancy and GDP per capita by year for different countries and regions,
explore and visualize the data using appropriate plots, and develop meaningful insights. You may notice some trends for
each country or region, as well as an overall tendency. Think about the following questions:

1. For each geographic unit, is there a clear correlation between GDP per capita and life
   expectancy?
2. What are the geographic units with the highest and lowest life expectancy? What about
   their GDP?
3. What other potential issues could take place in the geographic units with a lower life
   expectancy?
4. In general, is life expectancy in the modern world growing? And GDP?
